587 Assignment 3 User Manual

My source code was based on rendering tutorials given by Allan Rocha. Almost all of the work is done on the SceneShader.cpp file with the exception of naming a variable in the SceneShader.h file and allowing the switching of different models by hitting keys in the main.cpp file.

I've implemented all the required models plus bonus extension one.

To run the program extract the zip folder and open up a terminal and simply enter the command "./run" without the quotes. This will bring up an OpenGL Window automatically loading the first model.

The user controls are simple, you just enter the number keys 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 to switch between the following models:

1 = Mass on a spring
2 = Pendulum
3 = Jello cube
4 = Hanging cloth
5 = Flag in the wind

A couple other notes on my code:

- I used structures for my points and springs, where the points are the two masses on each spring
- Each spring refers to the points through indexing
- I've implemented both air damping and spring damping, the air damping variable is the global variable b and the spring damping variables are defined for each spring
- Each model had its rest lengths, masses and spring constants arbitrarily chosen to have a more or less realistic simulation
- As for my bonus "flag in the wind" simulation I simply added an equal gravitational force to operate on the x-axis for my force value if option 5 is selected in my "refresh" method in the SceneShader.cpp file (this may seem like a hack but in my defense the requirement only said to simulate one of the problems and I chose the flag flapping in the wind, it also didn't say to implement a specific technique and it looks realistic enough :P)
